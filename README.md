# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
In this project, I used what I know about machine learning to build a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if they are funded by Alphabet Soup. I used a CSV with over 34,000 organizations that had been funded by Alphabet Soup. This dataset includes information about the organization's success, income, asking amount, and much more. 

## Results

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
